arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1] 

puts arr.index(5)
puts arr[5]
# 1. arr.index(5) - This returns 3 as 5 occurs first as the fourth value stored in the array.  

# 2. arr.index[5] - This returns an error message as index needs to have values around parentheses, not square brackets.

# 3. arr[5] - This returns 8 as 8 is the sixth value stored in the array.
